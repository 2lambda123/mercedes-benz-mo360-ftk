# Before you start with the FTK

## Know and understand React & Typescript

The boilerplate is based on [React](https://reactjs.org) with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
To be fully able to use it efficiently, you should be familiar with both technologies and understand their core concepts.
Why we use React & Typescript is explained [here](../faq/why-react-and-typescript.md).

If you haven't worked with React before, it's documentation and tutorial section might be a good point to start:

- [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/)
- [React tutorials](https://reactjs.org/docs/)

As the FTK heavily uses the Context-API and Hooks, you should get familiar with both concepts:

- [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

If you're new to [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), you should work through it's [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).

Other technologies you should be familiar with:

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [GitHub](http://github.com/)
