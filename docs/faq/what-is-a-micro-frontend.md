# What is a Micro-Frontend?

As the name suggest the concept of Micro-Frontends is inspired by the software development technique called [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices).
The difference is that instead of splitting and loosely coupling parts of a server-side application it is the frontend which gets divided into several individual chunks.
Those chunks (we call them SWIDGET) are then loaded during runtime and integrated into the host application.
A good overview and description about the principles and concept is available at [micro-frontends.org](https://micro-frontends.org/).
