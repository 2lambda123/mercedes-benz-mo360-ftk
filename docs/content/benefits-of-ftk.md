# Benefits of FTK

> Describing the benefits of a toolkit is a hard task, because it always depends on the perspective / role from which you look at it.
> On the one side we have a project owner / project manager who cares for production speed, efficiency and overall costs.
> On the other side there are software developers who care for easiness, reusability and code quality.
> Both sides share the same goal but with totally different perspectives.
